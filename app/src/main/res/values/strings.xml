        <item>When a heavy door slams behind you, you will find yourself in the dark depths of history.
            525 BC. Egypt, the last independent state of the ancient world, was conquered by the Persians.
            Cambyses II, the son of Cyrus, has already described himself as a new pharaoh, but he
            has no power over the wisdom of the conquered country, the priests have hidden
            the Secret Chamber from the enemies. The Chamber of Secrets was the last exam in the way
            of the priest to the highest rank - Ur, "high, sublime." Only one in a hundred passed
            the test, which was to solve all the riddles, to find a way out of it.
            This room was not only an incorruptible pass to the dignity of Ur, but also a treasure
            trove of knowledge. Scrolls with prescription potions, drawings of unprecedented devices
            would enrich anyone to whom they fell into the hands.
            Cambyses II sent in search of Ur Rah, the Guardian of the Chamber of Secrets, the last
            bearer of the rank, the hundred best warriors. The three most cunning ones hunted down
            the priest on the threshold of the Secret Chamber and burst in after him, but
            they could not get out.
            And now, after thousands of years, the seekers of treasures and adventures accidentally
            stepped outside its threshold. The door of the Secret Chamber slammed shut, and now,
            to get out into the sunlight, you have to go through Ur and unravel all the riddles
            of the pharaoh.</item>
        <item>An unguided train with passengers rushes to meet the freight train with pesticides,
            sweeping away everything in its path. Chemical catastrophe can not be avoided.
            All forces are involved, all attempts to stop the locomotive are vain, there are
            no plans for salvation.</item>
        <item>Agency \"Men in Black\" has been guarding our planet for many years from an extraterrestrial
            threat. Control of hundreds of thousands of aliens arriving on Earth and catching
            especially dangerous alien criminals are the main tasks of the agency. Agents of special
            services of the whole world dream of joining the ranks of people in black, but today
            you were invited to an internship on a secret base. Are you ready to open the door
